Cats are obligate carnivores and must eat a diet based primarily on animal protein and fat to stay healthy. Their digestive system is short and acidic, designed to process meat efficiently, so plant-based or low-protein diets do not meet their nutritional needs. High-quality commercial cat food labeled "complete and balanced" according to AAFCO standards should list meat (chicken, turkey, beef, fish, lamb) as the first few ingredients. Both wet and dry foods can be appropriate, but wet food offers extra moisture that supports urinary tract health and helps prevent dehydration, especially in cats that drink little water.

Adult cats usually thrive on two to three small meals per day rather than free-feeding all day. This pattern helps control weight, stabilizes blood sugar, and mimics their natural eating behavior of catching several small prey items. Always follow the feeding guidelines on the package and adjust according to your cat’s body condition — you should feel the ribs easily without seeing them. Treats and human food should be limited to less than 10 percent of daily calories to avoid obesity and nutritional imbalance. Many human foods are dangerous for cats, including onions, garlic, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, grapes, raisins, xylitol, raw dough, and bones that can splinter. Fresh water must be available at all times, preferably in several locations and changed daily. Many cats prefer running water from a pet fountain.

Kittens grow very quickly and have much higher energy and nutrient requirements than adults. They should eat four to six small meals per day until around six months old, then gradually reduce to three meals. Kitten-specific formulas provide more calories, higher protein, DHA for brain and eye development, and balanced minerals for bone growth. Wet kitten food is particularly helpful because it supplies extra moisture and is easier to chew while teeth are developing. Dry kitten food can be offered as well, but it should be small-sized and high quality. Never feed adult maintenance food to growing kittens because it lacks the necessary nutrients for proper development.

Grooming needs depend on coat length and individual habits. Short-haired cats generally need brushing once every week or two to remove loose fur and reduce hairballs. Medium-haired cats benefit from weekly brushing to prevent minor tangles. Long-haired cats often require daily brushing to avoid painful mats and keep their coat clean and shiny. Regular nail trimming every ten to fourteen days prevents claws from becoming too long and causing discomfort or injury. Ear cleaning is only needed if visible dirt is present — use a vet-approved cleaner and cotton ball, never inserting anything deep into the canal. Dental care is very important; brushing teeth several times a week with cat-safe toothpaste helps prevent periodontal disease, which is extremely common.

Cats communicate using a combination of body language, vocal sounds, scent marking, and physical contact. A tail held high with a slight curve at the tip usually signals friendliness and confidence. A slow blink is a sign of trust and affection, often called a “cat kiss.” Relaxed ears pointing forward and whiskers in a neutral position indicate contentment. Flattened ears, dilated pupils, a thrashing tail, and growling or hissing mean fear, anger, or feeling threatened. Purring most often expresses happiness or comfort, but cats also purr when they are in pain, stressed, or seeking reassurance. Meowing is primarily directed at humans and can mean greeting, hunger, attention-seeking, or distress. Chirps and trills are friendly vocalizations, frequently used by mother cats with kittens. Cats also mark territory by rubbing their cheeks on objects, scratching, and sometimes urine spraying.

Senior cats, generally those eleven years and older, require thoughtful adjustments to remain comfortable and healthy. They often develop arthritis, reduced kidney function, dental disease, hyperthyroidism, and vision or hearing loss. Veterinary check-ups should happen every six months, with blood and urine tests to monitor organ function early. Senior-specific diets usually contain lower phosphorus, higher-quality protein, added antioxidants, and joint-supporting ingredients like glucosamine. Wet food and extra water sources help maintain hydration. Warm, soft beds in draft-free areas, low-entry litter boxes, ramps or steps for furniture, and night lights improve mobility and safety. Grooming becomes more important because older cats groom themselves less effectively. Gentle, short play sessions and puzzle feeders keep the mind active and help prevent cognitive decline. Any change in appetite, weight, litter box habits, drinking, or behavior should prompt an immediate veterinary visit.

Signs of illness in cats are often subtle because they instinctively hide weakness. Lethargy, sleeping far more than usual, hiding, or refusing to play can indicate pain or sickness. A sudden decrease or increase in appetite, unexplained weight loss or gain, or refusal to eat are serious warnings. Drinking much more water than normal or visiting the litter box frequently may signal kidney disease or diabetes. Litter box problems such as urinating outside the box, straining, small amounts of urine, blood in urine, diarrhea, or constipation should never be ignored. Frequent vomiting (more than once or twice a month), especially with blood or bile, is concerning. Coughing, sneezing, runny eyes or nose, wheezing, or open-mouth breathing can point to respiratory infection or other issues. Poor coat condition, matted fur, over-grooming in one spot, bad breath, limping, excessive drooling, or unusual vocalizing are additional red flags. Any noticeable change in normal behavior deserves prompt veterinary attention.

Cats need mental and physical stimulation every day to stay happy and prevent behavioral problems. Interactive play with wand toys, laser pointers (supervised), feather teasers, and crinkle balls satisfies hunting instincts. Puzzle feeders and treat balls make cats work for food, providing mental exercise. Scratching posts (both vertical and horizontal), cat trees, shelves, tunnels, and window perches offer climbing, observation, and exercise opportunities. In multi-cat households, provide separate resources to reduce competition and stress.

Litter box hygiene is essential. The guideline is one box per cat plus one extra. Scoop daily and change litter completely every one to two weeks. Unscented, clumping litter is preferred by most cats. Boxes should be placed in quiet, easily accessible locations away from food and water bowls. Low-sided boxes help kittens and senior cats enter comfortably.

Regular veterinary care prevents and detects problems early. Core vaccinations (FVRCP and rabies), deworming, flea and tick prevention, and spaying or neutering are foundational. Dental exams and cleanings help prevent periodontal disease. Senior cats benefit from more frequent blood work and urine tests.

Creating a safe, enriched environment helps cats thrive. Window perches, cardboard boxes, paper bags, hiding spots, and safe outdoor access (catio or harness) provide entertainment and reduce stress. Comfortable bedding in quiet areas supports their long sleeping hours (12–16 hours per day on average).

When cared for properly with balanced nutrition, regular vet visits, mental and physical activity, good grooming, clean litter facilities, and attentive observation, cats can live long, happy, and healthy lives as wonderful companions.
