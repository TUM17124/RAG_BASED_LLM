S sure why cats purr, except that it seems, in part at least, to be one way of showing that they feel very strongly about us. We do not fully understand what constitutes intensity in a cat’s mind, or even how, what, and to what degree cats think; but they do think - that much has been determined - and we’d like to believe that they think good things about us. They certainly purr when they are around us. They apparently like us as much as we like them. The affection and respect for animals that m

ly like us as much as we like them. The affection and respect for animals that many people share resulted in the formation of the The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in 1866. It is the Western Hemisphere’s oldest humane society, whose purpose, as stated by its founder, Henry Bergh, is “to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States.” Bergh’s initial efforts on behalf of animals struck a resonant cord throughout the count

initial efforts on behalf of animals struck a resonant cord throughout the country. Within five years, additional SPCAs could be found from coast to coast. Each of these SPCAs was a separate, individual society, formed to meet the needs of its own community. While they were not directly connected with Bergh’s ASPCA, they did share his commitment and goals, and still frequently rely on the APSCA for guidance and advice.

Authorized as peace officers, its Humane Law Enforcement agents continue Bergh’s work by investigating instances of cruelty to animals. The ASPCA’s educational and legislative programs reach millions of people across the country each year.

Roger Caras President (1991-1999) American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals As you will learn, cats have been domesticated for roughly 4,000 years. Over these many centuries cats have fared quite differently in many cultures. The Egyptians, the first people to live with cats, came to worship them.

This no doubt helps to account for their ever-increasing popularity around the world. cats Sometimes we can have too much of a good thing.

Enjoy those years of companionship, because they will certainly be special for both of you. 7 Introduction It IS ONLY during the last few thousand years that the cat has become domesticated, developing from small, wild ancestors that first roamed the Earth about 12 million years ago. Even before then, the larger cats,

roamed the Earth about 12 million years ago. Even before then, the larger cats, such as lions, tigers, and leopards, were developing from a few prototypes, while other members of the cat family branched in a different direction to become specialist hunters like the cheetah, or small, forest-dwelling felines like the ocelot and the margay. As people moved around the world, the cat went with them. The earliest signs of domestication were probably seen in the Middle East. The Ancient Egyptians wer

f domestication were probably seen in the Middle East. The Ancient Egyptians were the first civilization to realize the cat’s potential as a vermin hunter, that protected the grain supplies on which their lives depended. It is not surprising, then, that this reliance turned to worship. The cat became a deity in Ancient Egypt and was almost as well¬ loved as it is today. Although it is not regarded as a deity anymore, worship has been replaced with a caring, loving relationship with presentday ow

worship has been replaced with a caring, loving relationship with presentday owners. Having enjoyed many years of great favor, it was perhaps inevitable that fortune should turn against the cat for a black period in its history. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, human ignorance and bigotry were directed at anything that could be blamed for the world's ills, and, just as the Ancient Egyptians looked upon the cat as an expression of divinity, religious groups in Europe encouraged a phase

cat as an expression of divinity, religious groups in Europe encouraged a phase of hatred and fear, resulting in the cat being seen as an agent of the devil. This period eventually passed, however, and the elegance, beauty, engaging personality, and inestimable value of the cat as a companion were finally recognized. It is now one of the most popular pets in the world. Essential Care Deciding to add a cat to your household should not be taken lightly if you and your pet are to be happy together.

sehold should not be taken lightly if you and your pet are to be happy together. Therefore, it is essential that you know exactly how to care for a cat; from choosing a healthy kitten, to reproduction, house training, and basic discipline. A major section of this book covers all the varied aspects of day-to-day cat care. Becoming a cat owner is a serious business, and this chapter gives advice on what to look for when adopting or purchasing your pet, basic equipment such as cat collars and baske

All cat owners need some guidance on how to recognize health problems with their pets and what action to take when something is not ri

health problems with their pets and what action to take when something is not right. The extensive health care section of this manual deals with everyday problems such as ear mites, worms, and fleas, as well as first aid in emergencies and treatment of serious illnesses. There is also a diagnosis chart, so you can quickly find the cause of your pet’s problem and the appropriate treatment. Owners are also advised how to nurse a sick cat, so that it recovers quickly and without stress. In all case

to nurse a sick cat, so that it recovers quickly and without stress. In all cases, owners are urged to consult their local veterinary practice for help and guidance. Reproduction is extensively covered in a special section, with advice on planning a litter, helping your cat give birth, and caring for young kittens. There is even information on how different genes are passed on to give your pet certain characteristics, and first aid for your cat in the event of any problems both during and after

─ Chunk 27 (500 chars) ─────────────────────────────────────────
, and first aid for your cat in the event of any problems both during and after giving birth, or if the kittens are sickly. Showing Your Cat You may want to enter your cat in shows, and this book explains all you need to know about preparing for competition. Even if you do not, grooming is still an essential part of everyday feline care, especially for longhaired cats. The chapter on grooming describes how various types of feline coat should be groomed, and how to bathe your pet and care for its

pes of feline coat should be groomed, and how to bathe your pet and care for its teeth and claws. Special grooming for a cat show is also included, along with information on how a pedigree cat is judged. Finding Out More The glossary explains the specialized feline terms used in the book. Finally there is a short section providing information on the various feline organizations, as well as suggestions for further reading.

In Egypt, the cat was revered as a hunter, and it became deified as an incarnation of the goddess Bastet. Other ancient civilizations later began to domesticate the cat, and Phoenician traders took tame felines to Italy; from there they spread slowly across Europe. Eventually, they even migrated to the New World with

Despite a period of persecution in the Middle Ages, when cats were associated with the devil, by the eighteenth century cats had become popular as household pets and had spread all over the world.

It has tabby markings. The cats we know today, from lions and tigers to household pets, are descended from early carnivores called the miacids, which evolved from the first carnivorous mammals, the creodonts. While some miacids became lions, tigers, and cheetahs, Martelli’s wild cat (Felis lunensis) is thought to

It gave rise to the modern wild cat (Felis sylvestris), which developed into three main types: the European wild cat, the African wild cat, and the Asiatic desert cat. The domestic cat (Felis catus) is thought to have evolved from the African wild cat. European wild cat This may have added genes to the domestic cat by interbreeding. Jungle cat (left) Kept in Anci

e domestic cat, like those of its wild relatives, are designed for the purpose of stalking and killing prey. Its sense organs are those of a predator, and it can detect the slightest movement and the faintest sound. A cat’s hearing, sight, touch, and smell are far more acute than in humans and most other mammals. It can see in the dimmest of lights; it can detect very high-pitched noises; and it can even taste certain smells by using the Jacobson’s organ in the roof of its mouth. A cat is highly

n smells by using the Jacobson’s organ in the roof of its mouth. A cat is highly sensitive to its surroundings and will thrive under the right conditions, but it may not do so well in a home where its needs are not met. Shy cats and children often do not mix; loud noises and sudden movements can be frightening. THE FIVE SENSES The mouth and taste A cat has a discriminating sense of taste.

CATS AND CATNIP The smell of catnip or catmint (Nepeta cataria) is irresistible to most, but not all, cats. Many cats react to the plant by sniffing it, rubbing their heads in it, rolling around in a trancelike state on their backs, and purring loudly. The effects of catnip are shortlived, and it is not thought to be addictive or to cause any unpleasant aftereffects. Another plant, valerian, produce

Sniffing catnip (left) A cat sniffs the scent of dried catnip for a few seconds before it takes effect. Some cats are not susceptible to the plant and may show no visible signs.

Movement and Balance The eyes are fixed straight ahead The claws grip the branch The cat is a hunter and predator and needs to be quick on its feet and extremely agile. Its body is specifically designed for maximum speed from minimum effort. Most of the time a cat conserves its energy, but when it needs to, it is capable of sprinting very fast. A cat can travel at a top speed of approximately 30 miles (48 km) per hour over a short distance, enabling it to pounce on its prey before it can escape

Whereas most animals have to spend much of their lives on the ground, a cat has enviable coordination for climbing, jumping, and balancing. Balancing A cat is extremely well coordinated because it possesses a very efficient system for sending messages to the brain from its muscles and joints.

Do not encourage a kitten to play with combs or brushes; if it continues to do this in later life, it is likely to scratch you and make grooming difficult.

s, but some individuals may be rather timid and withdrawn. The root of the problem usually lies in the way a cat was raised. A kitten should be brought up in a stimulating environment, in which it feels secure. It should be encouraged to investigate new objects and to interact with other cats. A kitten that is not used to being handled and that is deprived of human attention will grow up into a cat that is timid and wary of humans.

Fleas are the most common cause of feline skin problems. Specks of “flea dirt” are easily seen in the coat, looking like large soot particles. Irritation can result from the fleas themselves or from sensitivity to their saliva or droppings. Fleas are involved in the life cycle of tapeworms and can lead to anemia. The flea life cycle Fleas

ANIMAL HOSPITALS At the animal hospital or veterinary clinic, the cat will be kept in a cage under regular supervision until it has recovered from the anesthetic. When it wakes it will be unsteady on its feet for several hours. You will be allowed to take the cat home only when the vet is satisfied that it is on the mend.

As a cat gets older, the vital organs of its body deteriorate at different rates. Changes in the heart, brain, kidneys, and liver are the most life-threatening. Fortunately, these major organs have reasonable reserves of functional activity; more than half of the kidney function may, for example,

─ Chunk 490 (500 chars) ─────────────────────────────────────────
of functional activity; more than half of the kidney function may, for example, be lost without the cat showing any signs of illness. Given plenty of loving care and close veterinary management, many cats with quite advanced kidney failure may lead fairly normal, active lives. Regular health checkups by a vet can improve the quality of life of an elderly cat. An older cat will generally become less active and spend more time sleeping. Try not to disturb its daily routine and ensure that it has a

SIGNS OF OLD AGE The joints and muscles may become stiff and less supple Health checks You should keep a careful check on the health of an elderly cat. Watch out for any signs of abnormal behavior and examine its eyes, ears, mouth, and coat regularly. Pay particular attention to its mouth and, if your cat will allow it, brush its teeth once a week.

These characteristics are determined by genes. They represent a set of instructions that determine the cat’s coat color, the length of its coat, and the color of its eyes. For every kitten in a litter, the genes are arranged in a different order, so each ind

ery kitten in a litter, the genes are arranged in a different order, so each individual is genetically unique, no matter how similar it is in appearance. If you wish to breed a show cat, look for a tomcat with suitable characteristics with which to mate your female. Mother and kitten This little kitten has a different coat color from both its parents. A CAT FAMILY TREE Determining coat color Kittens with very different coat colors result from the mating of Chocolate and Blue Burmese cats. One of

nt coat colors result from the mating of Chocolate and Blue Burmese cats. One of the kittens is the same color as the mother and one is identical to the father, but four have lighter coats. This is because the male is carrying a gene that dilutes the coat color from a silver-gray (Blue) to a lavender-gray (Lilac). 142 HEREDITY AND BREEDING INHERITED CHARACTERISTICS Manx cat (left) The Manx cat is a very old breed, but if someone applied today for its official recognition, this would probably not

t if someone applied today for its official recognition, this would probably not be granted. The Manx carries a gene that causes the deformity of taillessness, which is deadly if it is passed on by both parents. The mating of two Manx cats usually results in the kittens dying before or shortly after birth. Tortoiseshell cat (above) The orange gene that results in a tortoiseshell coat is linked to the gene that determines the cat’s sex. This means that nearly all tortoiseshell cats are female. Th

A “Stumpy" Manx has a Rogue genes (left) A few genes that are passed on from parents to offspring cause deformities. While some inherited traits, such as a kitten being born with extra toes (polydactyly), are relatively harmless, others, such as heart defects, are fatal.

Both breeds are believed to have developed from separate mutations. 143 BREEDING Planning a Litter Breeding your cat is an important decision that must be considered carefully. A female cat is sexually mature from about six months old and a male cat from about ten months. A queen comes into heat in two-week cycles, and each estrus lasts for two to four days.

Post-coital behavior After mating, both cats separate and groom themselves. The whole mating sequence will need to be repeated several times over a period of two to three days to ensure that the queen is pregnant. 6 The tom penetrates the queen and ejaculates immediately.

Prompt action in such cases as poisoning, choking, drowning, burns, bites, and stings can save life and prevent unnecessary suffering. First aid does not mean setting up a do-it-yourself veterinary practice. Your primary objectives must be to prevent further injury to the cat, to alleviate pain and distress, and to help begin the recovery process. Getting help from a vet is the highest priority. You should restrict yourself to tak

ing help from a vet is the highest priority. You should restrict yourself to taking only immediate necessary action to stabilize the cat’s condition until veterinary assistance is available. J 157 FIRST AID Principles of First Aid First aid is important as an interim measure before professional veterinary help is available, and it may save your cat’s life in an emergency. An injured cat may require urgent first aid to stop bleeding, treat shock, and restart or clear its breathing. The objectives

─ Chunk 543 (500 chars) ─────────────────────────────────────────
o stop bleeding, treat shock, and restart or clear its breathing. The objectives of first aid should be: to prevent the cat’s condition from worsening; to remove any source of harm; to alleviate pain and suffering; and to help with the recovery process. The absolute mle is to do no harm. Take essential action only and seek advice on the next course of action from a vet as soon as possible.

a cat is unconscious or having difficulty breathing, place it on its side with the head tilted downward. Open the mouth and ensure that the airway is clear. 159 FIRST AID Accidents The most important thing to do in the event of an accident is to contact a vet as soon as possible. Even if a cat appears to have no external injuries, it should be given a checkup, since there may be internal damage. A vet or trained assistant can advise on immediate first aid measures. If time is critical, ask some

istant can advise on immediate first aid measures. If time is critical, ask someone to telephone the clinic and alert the vet that you are on the way. Accidental falls A cat is unlikely to injure itself if it falls from a tree, but injuries do occur with falls from greater heights. All windows should have screens to prevent your cat from accidentally falling. MOVING AN UNCONSCIOUS CAT IMove the injured cat out of any danger area. A blanket or coat will serve as an improvised stretcher. Lay the b

danger area. A blanket or coat will serve as an improvised stretcher. Lay the blanket out flat and then gently ease the cat onto it. 3 Ensure that the airway is clear by removing any fluid from the mouth and pulling the tongue forward (see ). Stop any severe bleeding by covering the wound with a pressure bandage or gauze pad (see ). 2 With the help of an assistant, gently lift the blanket up, taking care not to let the cat slip off. If the cat is conscious, you may need someone to restrain it.

FIRST AID WARNING Transport and handle a cat with a fractured limb so as to cause it the minimum disturbance. Do not attempt to apply a splint yourself, since this will distress an injured cat and probably do more harm than good. FIRST AID Resuscitation ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION Prompt action taken in an emergency situation, such as a traffic accident (see pages 160-161), may save your cat’s life. Fortunately, emergencies are rare, but they usually occur without warning and allow little or no time

es are rare, but they usually occur without warning and allow little or no time to get professional help. If a cat is unconscious and its breathing and heartbeat have stopped, get someone to telephone the vet for you in order to obtain immediate advice while you try to save the animal’s life. Resuscitation must be carried out following the guidelines given opposite (or by a vet), to ensure that a cat has the best chance of recovery. A cat may suffer respiratory and heart failure following drowni

nce of recovery. A cat may suffer respiratory and heart failure following drowning, electric shock, or poisoning. For the cat to survive, its breathing or heart must be restarted within a few minutes. The mouth should be open to ease breathing 1 Remove the cat’s collar. Lay the cat on one side in the recovery position (see ). Open the mouth and clear the airway of any fluid (see ). 2 If the cat has stopped breathing but the heart is still beating, proceed with artificial respiration. Using a tow

but the heart is still beating, proceed with artificial respiration. Using a towel, pull the tongue forward to clear the throat. This may stimulate breathing, causing the cat to regain consciousness. 3 If the cat remains unconscious, place your hands on the chest and apply gentle pressure. This expels air from the lungs, allowing them to be refilled with fresh air. Repeat every five seconds until the cat breathes. CARDIAC MASSAGE If a cat is unconscious and there is no sign of a heartbeat or bre

RDIAC MASSAGE If a cat is unconscious and there is no sign of a heartbeat or breathing, direct stimulation of the heart may be attempted. Place your fingers on the chest at the point of the elbow and press down gently but firmly. Repeat five or six times at one- second intervals. Alternate with artificial respiration for up to ten minutes, after which the procedure is unlikely to be successful. 16 2 RESUSCITATION MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION Ilf the chest cavity has been damaged, the lungs may n

ter, but accidents do happen - for example, a kitten may fall into a pond or a swimming pool. 2 Take the cat out of the water and dry it quickly with a towel. If the cat is motionless, drain any water from the lungs. Hold the cat upside down by firmly gripping its hind legs above the ankle joints. A firm grip keeps the cat from slipping 3 Swing the cat vigorously (but not violently) downward to remove water from the lungs. If there are still no signs of the cat resuming breathing, resuscitation

lungs. If there are still no signs of the cat resuming breathing, resuscitation should be started (see opposite). Get the cat into warm surroundings as soon as possible. 163 FIRST AID Choking and Foreign Bodies Professional help from a vet is essential if a cat is having any difficulty with its breathing. However, in the unlikely event of a foreign body becoming lodged in your cat’s throat, you may not have time to call a vet. You will need to take emergency action. A cat with an object such as

hook is superficial, the barb can be carefully cut off with pliers or wire cutters. 164 CHOKING AND FOREIGN BODIES FOREIGN BODY IN THE EYES 1 Grass seeds and tiny pieces of grit are the most common objects to become lodged in a cat’s eyes. Hold the eyelids open and examine the eye carefully. If something has penetrated the eyeball, do not touch it. 2 If the foreign body is loose or under the eyelid, you may be able to float it out with eye drops or one or two drops of olive oil. If you are in an

OTHER FOREIGN BODIES Foreign body in the ears Similar techniques to those above can be used to remove objects such as grass seeds, from just inside the ear. Float out seeds using ear drops or one or two drops of olive oil. FIRST AID WARNING Never poke tweezers or anything else into a cat’s ears or eyes. A great deal of damage is done this way by well- meaning owners who do more harm than good.

l of damage is done this way by well- meaning owners who do more harm than good. Remember: if in doubt, it is always best to call in a vet. Foreign body in the paws Grass seeds and burrs can become stuck in the fur between the toes, or a cat can get a splinter in its paw. If a cat cannot remove the object with its teeth, it may need to be dislodged by hand or using tweezers. Do not try to remove any object that is embedded in the paw pad. It is advisable to consult a vet if the injury is more th

bedded in the paw pad. It is advisable to consult a vet if the injury is more than a superficial scratch. 165 FIRST AID Poisoning Poisoning is not a common occurrence, since cats are extremely careful feeders and also vomit very readily if they have eaten anything harmful. However, a cat may ingest a poison accidentally by eating either plants that have been treated with insecticides or poisoned prey. If a cat’s coat becomes contaminated with chemicals, it will lick them off in an attempt to cle

She may reject the kittens shortly after the birth, or the runt of the litter may be ousted by its siblings. Like many animals, a cat produces several offspring to allow for some not surviving to adulthood in the wild. Rejected kittens may be fostered by another queen or reared by hand (see ).

Competition among entrants to have their feline judged to be the best of a breed or best in a category is always intense. The formalities for entering a cat in a competition and the ways in which different types of cat show are organized vary around the world. Shows often have classes for household pets, and this is probably a good place for a beginner

ve classes for household pets, and this is probably a good place for a beginner to start. The competitive drive of showing your cat can become totally absorbing, so be warned! 177 SHOWING Cat Shows Breeders constantly strive to produce the finest cats for exhibition, so visiting a show can be a rewarding and educational experience. Almost every familiar breed is likely to be present at a large cat show, as well as a few rare ones not generally seen. Shows are run by the controlling authority for

few rare ones not generally seen. Shows are run by the controlling authority for all cat clubs and societies in a particular country. In the United States, the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA) and other cat organizations establish breed standards, register pedigrees, and approve the dates of major shows. In Great Britain, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) is responsible for the show rules and has approved standards for all the pedigree cat breeds. The first modern cat show (below) Cry

standards for all the pedigree cat breeds. The first modern cat show (below) Crystal Palace in London was the venue for the first large cat show, which took place in 1871. Longhairs and British Shorthairs were among the cats exhibited. The first North American cat show was held in New England for the Maine Coon breed at about the same time.

Kittens compete with others of the same breed, sex, and color. At a large show, kitten classes for popular breeds may be divided by sex or by age. Neuter class Pedigree cats that are castrated males or spayed females have separate open classes of their own. They compete against other neuters of the same breed and a

BRITISH AND AMERICAN SHOWS Shows in Great Britain All cat shows operate under the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy. After a veterinary inspection, cats are given a number. Pens are numbered but carry no other distinguishing marks. Judging takes place on a table that is wheeled from pen to pen (see)■ Open class The most important of all the classes. At

st in pedigree cats has played a central role in creating the rich spectrum of breeds we see today. Selective breeding programs have been used to enhance particular physical characteristics and to create cats that look attractive to the human eye. Fortunately, in contrast to dog breeding, there have been few instances of this having harmful effects. A pedigree cat is judged against a standard that specifies how a perfect example of its type should look. Points are awarded for the appearance of t

Carefully brush the shorter hairs on the cat’s face with a small toothbrush. Do not put the toothbrush too close to the eyes. 3 As a finishing touch, use a slicker brush to make the cat’s fur stand out fully from its body. The fur around the cat’s neck should frame the face.
